  <p>Since no product or service is perfect, it makes complete sense that customers will have some complaints from time to time. Though there will inevitably be some one-off requests that require research to resolve, many are fairly routine. In this article, we’ll explore the three types of customer complaints, look at examples of common requests, and offer suggestions on how to resolve them, including some example responses you can use for your own support needs.</p>
<p>Time based We all know that time is valuable. It’s the one thing we can’t make more of or get back once it’s gone. Time-based complaints are essentially complaints based around something not happening in the timeframe the customer expects. The best way to handle these types of complaints is by being as specific about times and processes as you can possibly be. Most people reaching out with a time-based complaint are looking to be heard as well as reassured. Offering concrete timelines and steps can help on the reassurance front. Owning delays can also go a long way in letting the customer know you hear and empathize with them. Company based Company-based complaints are complaints that are about how your business operates or about direct interactions with your company. For example, this type of complaint could be someone reaching out after having a less-than-stellar interaction with someone on your team. It could also be a complaint about a company policy. In these cases, it’s good to acknowledge the issue. If it’s a personnel issue, then you can assure them about following up or you can escalate to a manager. If it’s a policy issue, you could do your best to offer some more insight into why a certain policy is in place.</p>
